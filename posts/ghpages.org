:title: Set up hosting using GutHub's gh-pages

Guthub provides a really nice mechanism for hosting a site associated
with a repo using [[http://pages.github.com/][Github Pages]]. Initial setup is described [[https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually][here]]. In
short, the content of the site is stored in an "orphan" branch called
"gh-pages". There's a mechanism for publishing to a subdirectory of
the main repository using git submodules, but I've never enjoyed using
this feature of git. So I did this.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :eval no :exports code
cd ~/src
git clone git@github.com:nhoffman/blog.git blog-publish
cd blog-publish
git checkout --orphan gh-pages
git rm -rf .
#+END_SRC

I'll come up with something more automated for deployment, but for
now:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :eval no :exports code
cp ~/src/blog/site/* ~/src/blog-publish 
#+END_SRC

Add, commit, and publish.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :eval no :exports code
git add .
git commit -a -m "First pages commit"
git push origin gh-pages
#+END_SRC

Now the site is published: http://nhoffman.github.com/blog/

Thanks, Github!
