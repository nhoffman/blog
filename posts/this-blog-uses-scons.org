I have gotten a lot of use out of the build tool [[http://www.scons.org/][scons]], and so it's
the natural choice in this context, where I have to script the
compilation of posts, need to keep track of dependencies, and want to
avoid re-compiling anything that has not changed.

So here's the workflow for creating a new post (at the moment):

- create a new file based on =posts/_post.org=
- fill in empty fields in PROPERITES
- compile the new post, then recompile all of the static pages.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :eval no :exports code 
scons && scons
#+END_SRC
- publish to Github pages
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output :exports both 
scons publish
#+END_SRC

Here's the entire SConstruct file that I use to build this static site:

#+INCLUDE: SConstruct src python
